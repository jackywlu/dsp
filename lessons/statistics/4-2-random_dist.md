[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Exercise: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```
My code:

random_values = np.random.random(1000)
```

```
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_values)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Numpy random variable', ylabel='PMF')
```

There are so many different x-values that aren't put into bins, so it's extremely difficult to read the PMF. It looks like the distribution is uniform (all the x-values have around a 0.001 chance of appearing), but that's because there are probably no values that appear more than once. 

```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_values)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Numpy random variable', ylabel='CDF')
```

The distribution is uniform. The CDF is a pretty straight line from 0 to 1, which indicates that there aren't any numbers that are much higher or lower to appear than other numbers. For example, it looks like 20% of the sample (numbers from 0 to 0.2) have a CDF around 0.2.
