[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Exercise: The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```
My code:

random_values = np.random.random(1000)
```

```
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_values)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Numpy random variable', ylabel='PMF')
```

```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_values)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Numpy random variable', ylabel='CDF')
```
